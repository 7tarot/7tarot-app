7TAROT — Installments Pack (drag & drop)

What this adds
- A small notice bar under the header: “Installment options available at checkout…”
- A “Payment options” section explaining that PayPal Pay Later and Clearpay/Afterpay (via Stripe) may be available, depending on location + eligibility.
- A subtle “Installments available*” pill badge over product images.

How to use
1) Unzip.
2) GitHub → your repo → Add file → Upload files → drag **index.html** and **app.js** into the repo root (overwrite).
3) Commit → Netlify redeploys.
4) (Optional) If you don’t want the badge on every item, tell me which items to show it on and I’ll tailor it.

Note
This is informational messaging only. Actual installment options depend on your connected payment providers and plan, and may vary by customer location/eligibility.
