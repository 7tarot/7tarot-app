7TAROT — Full Layout + Matrix Rain (Messenger‑friendly)

What this bundle does
- Restores your full Shop • Raffle • Meanings • Contact layout
- Brings back the Matrix rain background
- Keeps Messenger/Instagram in‑app fixes (viewport + text-size-adjust + tip)
- Keeps URL cleaner (removes fbclid/utm_* after load)
- Keeps link preview tags (OG/Twitter) so Messenger shows a nice card

How to use
1) Unzip.
2) GitHub → your repo → Add file → Upload files → drag these into the repo root (overwrite if asked):
   - index.html
   - app.js
   - assets/og-image.png
   - assets/raffle-placeholder.png
3) Commit → Netlify redeploys.
4) Optional: In app.js, set RAFFLE.endsAt like '2025-09-05T22:00:00+01:00' for a live countdown.

If anything looks off in Messenger’s in‑app browser, send a screenshot and I’ll fine‑tune the CSS.
