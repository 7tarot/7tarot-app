7TAROT — Clean Link Patch (drag & drop)

This patch auto-removes fbclid/gclid/utm_* from your URL so shared links look clean.

How to use:
1) Unzip.
2) GitHub → your repo → Add file → Upload files → drag **app.js** into the repo root (overwrite the existing file).
3) Commit → Netlify redeploys → hard refresh your site.

No other changes needed.
